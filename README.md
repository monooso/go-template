# Go template

A template to start a new Go project with the minimum of fuss and bother.

## Features
- Adds a basic README.
- Adds a `go.mod` file.
- Adds a basic `.gitignore`.
- Add `mise.toml`, if required.
- Adds the open-source license of your choosing, if required.

## Getting started
This is a [kickstart template](https://github.com/Keats/kickstart) so you will need to have `kickstart` installed:

```bash
$ brew install kickstart
```

Once `kickstart` is installed, run:

```bash
$ kickstart https://github.com/monooso/go-template
```

## Steps left for you
Write the code. Who are we kidding? AI writes the code. Maybe make a nice cup of tea.
